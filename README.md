# GLX_Autostaking
Genesis League Token Autostaking Program

This program is written in C# and is intended to stake GLX automaticly

There is a compiled version of this program in the "compiled" folder for those who trust me 100%
This program makes use of your active keys so you should compile it yourself.  I am not a bad guy but never take these things for granted.
Either way its your choice.  I provide the file as an option.

The code is using the excelent Hive.NET library located here.
https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive-net

Once compiled you need to add a balance.txt file to the same folder as the executeable.
In this txt file you enter the number you want to save from being staked.  So for example say you have 10000 unstaked tokens and you don't want
this program to stake them.  You would enter 10000 and only 10000 into that file. No commas no extra lines.

There are 2 ways to use this program.
1.) Manually enter your keys and username following the prompts
2.) Hard code your username and keys into the program and compile.  (not reccomended)
